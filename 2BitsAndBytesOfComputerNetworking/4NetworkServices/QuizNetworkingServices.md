<br>

## Question 1

*DNS stands for _________.*

* Do Not Signal
* Domain Name System
* Dynamic Name Server
* Diversified Nomenclature System

## Question 2

*A concept that involves iterating over a list of items one by one in an orderly fashion is known as _______.*

* **round robin**
* recursion
* authoritative lookup
* multiplexing

> Round robin ensures a fairly equal distribution across its members.

## Question 3

*Along with an IP address, a subnet mask, and a name server, the other thing required for a computer to operate on a network is a _______.*

* proxy
* **gateway**
* NTP server
* FQDN

> Every networked device needs a gateway to know where to send network intended for outside of the local network segment.

## Question 4

*NAT stands for ______.*

* National Academic Translation
* Networking Association Team
* **Network Address Translation**
* Network Acknowledgement Track

> NAT, or Network Address Translation, allows for a device to rewrite the source IP in a packet.

## Question 5

*VPN stands for _______*

* Very Personal Network
* **Virtual Private Network**
* Virtual Public Network
* Virtual Proxy Network

> A VPN allows a device to establish an encrypted tunnel to another network.

## Question 6

*Which type of Domain Name System (DNS) server performs a full name resolution request?*

* Authoritative name server
* Root name server
* Caching name server
* **Recursive name server**

> A recursive name server performs a full DNS resolution request.

## Question 7

*The "www" portion of a domain is known by which of the given options? Check all that apply.*

* Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
* Top Level Domain (TLD) name
* Host name
* **Subdomain**

> A subdomain like "www" precedes the domain name and is used to further identify a system and its purpose. (one more option)

## Question 8

*Which of the following allows computers on a network to automatically receive address assignment information?*

* **Dynamic Host Protocol (DHCP)**
* Primary gateway
* Domain Name System (DNS)
* Time to Live (TTL)

> DHCP is used to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on a network.

## Question 9

*Which technique is used with Network Address Translation (NAT) where a source port chosen by a client is the same port used by a router?*

* Masquerading
* Forwarding
* Translation
* **Preservation**

> Preservation helps a router determine which traffic belongs to which host when using NAT.

## Question 10

*An IT engineer is planning a website upgrade with load balancing features. What technology is used?*

* Port forwarding
* **Reverse proxy**
* Round robin
* Web proxy

>  A reverse proxy allows for load balancing of web server content.

## Question 11

*What benefits does the Domain Name System (DNS) provide? Check all that apply.*

* **Ease of address memorization**

> With DNS in place, there is no need to memorize hard to remember IP addresses.

* Network Address Translation (NAT)
* Assigning Internet Protocol (IP) addresses

* **Easy mapping to a new Internet Protocol (IP) address**

> DNS easily maps to a system's IP address, even if that address changes.


## Question 12

*A company with a large number of hosts creates three subdomains under a main domain. For easier management of the host records, how many zones should be used?*

* **4**
* 3
* 1
* 2

> Four (4) zones would include the parent and the three (3) subdomains.

## Question 13

*Which of the following is NOT configured by a Dynamic Host Protocol (DHCP) server?*

* Gateway address
* Subnet mask address
* Internet Protocol (IP) address
* **Media Access Control (MAC) address**

> A MAC address is a hardware address assigned to a device by the manufacturer.

## Question 14

*An internal system behind a firewall needs to be configured for remote access. How should Network Address Translation be configured?*

* Rewriting
* One-to-many NAT
* **Port forwarding**
* Preservation

> Forwarding external traffic to the system by using port forwarding maintains internal address secrecy.

## Question 15

*The Domain Name System (DNS) provides an easy way to remember addresses. Without DNS, how many octets for an Internet Protocol (IP) address would have to be memorized?*

* 48
* 10101010
* 32
* **4**

> An IP address is presented with 4 octets separated by decimals, like 192.168.1.1.

## Question 16

*During the name resolution process, which technique is used to avoid congestion when querying a server?*

* **Anycast**
* Lookup
* Redirect
* Hierarchy

>  Anycast allows a request to be sent to an appropriate server based on factors, like location. This helps relieve severe congestion.
