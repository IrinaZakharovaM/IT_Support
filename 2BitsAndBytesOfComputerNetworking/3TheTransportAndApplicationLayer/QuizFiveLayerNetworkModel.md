## Question 1

Question 1


* **Physical Layer** is responsible for sending computer bits from one device to another along the network. It transmits the data either optically, electrically or as radio waves.
* **Datalink layer** creates frames, which encapsulates Internet Layer's IP Datagram. It uses MAC addresses to find the source and destination host.
* **Network Layer** is moving data from one network to another network. Main protocol is IP that uses IP addresses to identify the source and destination of IP traffic.
* **Transport Layer** operates by 2 main protocols: TCP and UDP. This layer uses ports to send data to the correct applications.
* **Application layer** is the layer where the application itself is running. The examples are Web Browsers, Email Clients etc
