# Asymmetric Encryption

## Question 1

*Which of the following do asymmetric cryptosystems provide? Check all that apply.*

* Availability
* **Authenticity**
* **Non-repudiation**
* **Confidentiality**

> Confidentiality is provided by the encryption and decryption functionality, while authenticity and non-repudiation are ensured by the signing and verification processes.

## Question 2

*What advantages do asymmetric algorithms have over symmetric ones?* 

* **They allow secure communication over insecure channels.**
* They have very fast performance.
* They're easier to implement.
* They're more secure.

> By exchanging public keys for encrypting data, asymmetric encryption securely exchanges information over untrusted channels.

## Question 3

*What's a common application for asymmetric algorithms?*


* Full disk encryption
* Random number generation
* Secure password storage
* **Secure key exchange**

>  Asymmetric encryption schemes are perfect for securely exchanging small amounts of data over untrusted networks by exchanging public keys that are used for encrypting data.
