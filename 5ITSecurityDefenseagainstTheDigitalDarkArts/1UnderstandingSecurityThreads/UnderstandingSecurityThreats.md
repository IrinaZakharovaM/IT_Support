# Understanding Security Threats

## Question 1

*Phishing, baiting, and tailgating are examples of ________ attacks.*

* Password
* Malware
* **Social engineering**
* Network

> These three attack types are designed to trick or deceive people into trusting an attacker. Phishing accomplishes this via email, baiting uses physical props like USB drives, and tailgating happens when the attacker follows you into a restricted area.

## Question 2

*Botnets are designed to steal _____ from the victim.*

* Money
* Credit card information
* Username and passwords
* **Computing resources**

> Botnets are designed to infect machines and put them under the control of the botnet controller. They're used to perform computational or network tasks to steal computing resources, like CPU time, memory, and network bandwidth, from the victim.

## Question 3

*A SYN flood occurs when the attacker overwhelms a server with ______.*

* **SYN packets**
* Malware
* ACK packets
* Injection attacks

>  A SYN flood attack happens when the attacker floods the victim with SYN packets and never completes the TCP three-way handshake.

## Question 4

*The best defense against password attacks is using strong _______.*

* Antimalware software
* Firewall configs
* **Passwords**
* Encryption

> Strong passwords will make password attacks too time-consuming to be viable for an attacker.

## Question 5

*Which of these is an example of the confidentiality principle that can help keep your data hidden from unwanted eyes?*

* **Protecting online accounts with password protection**
* Making sure the data hasn't been tampered with
* Preventing data loss
* Preventing an unwanted download 

> Password protection can help limit access to your data so that only those who need it can see it.

## Question 6

*What could potentially decrease the availability of security and also test the preparedness of data loss?*

* Adware
* Keylogger
* Spyware
* **Ransomware**

> Ransomware could prevent access to your data by holding the data hostage until you pay a ransom.

## Question 7

*Which of these is true of blackhat and whitehat hackers?*

* **Blackhats are malicious. Whitehats exploit weakness to help mitigate threats.**
* Blackhats try to find weaknesses, but whitehats don't.
* Blackhats work with owners to fix problems. Whitehats are just trying to get into a system.
* Blackhats and whitehats shouldn't be trusted.

> Blackhat hackers are trying to break into a system and do something malicious. Whitehats try to find weaknesses before the bad guy does, and reports them to get fixed.

## Question 8

*What is it called when a hacker is able to get into a system through a secret entryway in order to maintain remote access to the computer?*

* **A backdoor**
* Ransomware
* A Trojan
* Adware 

> A backdoor is a way for a hacker to get into a system through a secret entryway.

## Question 9

*An unhappy Systems Administrator wrote a malware program to bring down the company's services after a certain event occurred. What type of malware does this describe?*

* **A logic bomb**
* A rootkit
* Ransomware
* Spyware 

> A logic bomb is malware that is intentionally triggered by a hacker once a certain event or time has occurred.

## Question 10

Which of these is where a victim connects to a network that the victim thinks is legitimate, but is really an identical network controlled by a hacker to monitor traffic?

* A Denial of Service (DoS)
* **Evil Twin**
* A logic bomb
* DNS Cache Poisoning 

> The premise of an Evil Twin is for the victim to connect to a network that is identical to a legit one, but it is actually controlled by a hacker.

## Question 11

*What is it called if a hacker takes down multiple services very quickly with the help of botnets?*

* A SQL injection
* **Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)**
* A password attack
* Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

> DDoS attacks utilize multiple machines and can take down services in greater volumes and quicker rates.

## Question 12

*If a hacker targets a vulnerable website by running commands that delete the website's data in its database, what type of attack did the hacker perform?*

* Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
* A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack
* A dictionary attack
* **SQL injection**

>  A SQL injection targets an entire website if the site uses a SQL database. If vulnerable, hackers can run SQL commands that allow them to delete web data, copy it, and run other malicious commands.

## Question 13

*You receive a legitimate-looking email from a sender that you recognize asking you to click a funny link. But, once you do, malware installs on your computer. What is most likely the reason you got infected?*

* **The sender's email address was spoofed.**
* The sender’s email password was used in a DNS Cache Poisoning attack.
* The sender's email has been hacked.
* The sender’s email password was cracked.

> It is very easy to send an email and have the From field come from any address you want it to whether it exists or not. For example, you open an email stating it is from your friend's email address that asks you to click a funny link. To you, that seems like a legitimate email, but when you open the link, you suddenly get malware installed. In this case, an attacker spoofed the sender's email address!
