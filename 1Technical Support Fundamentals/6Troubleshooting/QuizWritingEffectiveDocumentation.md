# Writing Effective Documentation

<br>

## Question 1

**Overview**: Documentation is an important part of an IT Support Specialist role. It’s vital to document processes and policies not only for yourself but for your teammates that may encounter the same issue. This writing assessment will help you get in the habit of writing good documentation.

**What You'll Do**: For this writing project, you will write documentation to explain the process of making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to someone who has never seen one before. You’ll want to be detailed yet concise. Specifically, the documentation should have:

1) A description of the problem.
2) A description of the end result.
3) The solution detailed in a step-by-step manner.
