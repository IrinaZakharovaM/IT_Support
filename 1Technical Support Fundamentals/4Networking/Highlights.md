## What is Networking?

* The **Internet** (or **internet**) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (**TCP/IP**) to communicate between networks and devices.
* The **World Wide Web** (**WWW**), commonly known as the **Web**, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by **Uniform Resource Locators** (**URLs**, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[
* Computer on a network have an identifier called an **IP address**.
* Devices that can connect to a network have
* **MAC address** is generally permanent and hard-coded onto a device
* **Router**: Connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic.
* **Network stack**: A set of hardware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer.
* There are rules that make sure our packets are routed efficiently:
  * Routed efficiently.
  * Aren't corrupted.
  * Secure.
  * Right machine.
  * Named appropriately.
* **IP**: Responsible for delivering our packets to the right computers.
* **TCP**: Protocol that handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another. 
* **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**: Web address similar to a home address.

## Limitations of the Internet

* **IPv4**: Address that consists of 32 bits separated into four groups, something like 172.14.24.1
* **IPv6**: Address that consist of a 128 bits, four times the amount that IPv4 uses, something like 379f:3e7d:4860:0370:7334:0000
* **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Lets organizations use one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network.

## Impact of the Internet

* **Globalization**: The movement that lets governments, businesses, and organizations communicate and integrate together on an international scale.
